If you have a problem understanding or communicating with someone you care about -- a parent, a child, a co-worker, or a significant other -- the ideas in this book just may be what you have been looking for.  
如果您想知道對您重要的人或您周圍的人似乎在看世界或對情況做出反應的各種方式，並且通常以令人吃驚的不同方式，這本書將使您感興趣。 如果您在理解或與自己關心的人（父母，孩子，同事或重要的其他人）進行交流時遇到問題，那麼本書中的想法可能就是您一直在尋找的東西。  
  
The author, Isabel Briggs Myers, was my mother. After a twenty-year fight, she finally succumbed to cancer at the age of 82, just before publication of the first edition. Her goal was to help people to be happy and effective in whatever they chose to do, and the fierceness  of this desire gave her the strength to keep going until her book was finished. It is a tribute to her insight that, since 1980, over 100,000 people have read Gifts Differing, with more copies sold each year than in the previous year.  
作者伊莎貝爾·布里格斯·邁爾斯（Isabel Briggs Myers）是我的母親。經過二十年的奮戰，她終於在第一版出版前因癌症去世，享年82歲。她的目標是幫助人們在選擇做的事情上感到快樂和有效，而這種強烈的慾望使她有能力繼續前進，直到她的書完成為止。自從1980年以來，有超過100,000人閱讀了《不同禮物》，這是對她的見識的致敬，與上一年相比，每年銷售的副本數量更多。  
  
Her book presents, in understandable language, the ideas about personality type of the famous Swiss psychologist, Carl Gustav Jung, as they apply to normal everyday  people with normal everyday problems. Her book has helped thousands of people recognize the different ways in which each of us act and react and make sense of the world in our relationships with others. Her gift has been in repudiating the old, but too commonly held, idea that we are each in various ways a deviation from some ideal “normal person.” She replaced it with the recognition that each of us is born with different gifts, with unique imprints of how we prefer to use our minds and values and feelings in the business of living everyday. Jung divided the business of living every day into two simple mental activities: taking in, or becoming aware of, new information (which he called perception); and deciding, or coming to some conclusion about that information (which he didn’t bother to name).  
她的書以通俗易懂的語言介紹了著名的瑞士心理學家卡爾·古斯塔夫·榮格（Carl Gustav Jung）的人格類型觀念，因為這些觀念適用於有正常日常問題的正常人。她的書幫助成千上萬的人認識到我們每個人在與他人的關係中所採取的行動和反應的不同方式以及對世界的理解。她的天賦在於拒絕舊的但太普遍的想法，即我們以各種方式背離某個理想的“正常人”。她以認識到我們每個人都天生具有不同的天賦來取代它，並在我們日常生活中如何使用自己的思想，價值觀和感受留下獨特的烙印。榮格將每天的生活事務分為兩種簡單的心理活動：獲取或了解新信息（他稱為感知）；並就該信息做出決定或得出一些結論（他不願透露姓名）。  
  
Jung wrote about his theory of type more than 70 years ago, but as a practicing psychologist, he generally saw patients with severe psychological problems, and he was primarily concerned with the unsuccessful or unbalanced development of type he found in people who were ineffective, unhappy, and seeking professional help. He was not particularly interested in the aspects of psychological type displayed by ordinary healthy people. In addition, he wrote in German for a largely specialized audience of psychologists. Even the English translation of his work Psychological Types makes heavy reading. It is not surprising, therefore, that his theory of personality type found scant enthusiasm among ordinary people interested in human personality.  
榮格（Jung）於70多年前就寫過關於類型理論的文章，但作為一名實踐心理學家，他通常會看到患有嚴重心理問題的患者，他主要關心的是在無效，不滿意的人中發現的類型發展不成功或失衡 ，並尋求專業幫助。 他對普通健康人所表現出的心理類型方面並不特別感興趣。 此外，他還用德語寫了很多專門針對心理學家的文章。 即使是他的《心理類型》一書的英文譯本，也使他讀了很多書。 因此，不足為奇的是，他的人格類型理論在對人的人格感興趣的普通人中發現了很少的熱情。  
  
Isabel Myers, on the other hand, while not trained as a psychologist, devoted the entire second half of her life to interpreting and adapting Jung’s theory to help ordinary, healthy, normal people understand that it is all right to be unique individuals, often quite unlike those around them, and that many, if not most, of the differences, problems, and misunderstandings they may have experienced with others can be explained in terms of the perfectly normal, but different, choices in the way people take in and process information.  
另一方面，伊莎貝爾·邁爾斯（Isabel Myers）雖然沒有接受過心理學家的培訓，但她一生的後半生都致力於解釋和適應榮格的理論，以幫助普通，健康，正常的人們理解，成為獨特的個體是正常的，通常與周圍的人不同，他們與他人可能經歷的許多（即使不是大多數）差異，問題和誤解可以用人們接受和處理信息的方式的完全正常但不同的選擇來解釋。  
  
The premise of this book is that each of us has a set of gifts, a set of mental tools that we have become comfortable using and thus reach for in the everyday business of living. Although we all have access to the same basic tools in our psychological toolbox, each of us is more comfortable with and thus prefers a particular tool (or set of tools) for a particular task. It is our unique set of these preferences that gives us our distinct personality and makes us appear similar or dissimilar to others.  
本書的前提是我們每個人都有一套禮物，一套心理工具，我們已經習慣使用這些工具，從而可以在日常生活中得到廣泛應用。儘管我們所有人都可以使用心理工具箱中的相同基本工具，但我們每個人都比較習慣，因此更喜歡針對特定任務的特定工具（或一組工具）。正是這些獨特的偏好集合賦予了我們與眾不同的個性，使我們看起來與他人相似或不相似。  
  
A common problem that has often led to stress for many of us is our apparent inability, at times, to communicate about something that is very clear and personally very important to us to someone we care about in a way that that person agrees, or at least understands its importance to us. We may feel hurt and rejected by the lack of recognition of our concern or we may feel baffled by the failure of that person to appreciate the logic of our position. In Gifts Differing, Isabel Myers gives us recognizable explanations for these and many other normal, but different, uses of our personality tools and points the way to the constructive uses of human differences.  
常常導致我們許多人感到壓力的一個常見問題是，我們有時有時無法以我們同意的方式或與他人關心的方式向我們關心的人傳達對我們而言非常明確且個人非常重要的事情 最不了解它對我們的重要性。 我們可能因缺乏對我們關注的認識而受到傷害和拒絕，或者我們可能因那個人沒有欣賞我們立場的邏輯而感到困惑。 在《不同的禮物》中，伊莎貝爾·邁爾斯（Isabel Myers）為這些和其他許多正常但不同的人格工具用法提供了公認的解釋，並為人類差異的建設性使用指明了道路。  
  
To help put this book inperspective, a little history of how it came to be written may be appropriate. Isabel Myers and her mother Katharine Cook Briggs, had been interested in Jung’s theory for about 16 years when the Second World War took many men from the industrial workforce into the services and brought many women out of their normal activities to replace them. Since, for the majority of these women,  the heavy industrial workplace was strange new territory, my mother and grandmother thought that a knowledge of one’s personality preferences in terms of Jungian type theory might be a valuable aid to identifying the kind of job for the war effort in which someone without previous relevant experience could be most comfortable and effective. They searched in vain for a test or some indicator of a person’s Jungian preferences and finally decided to create one of their own. The result was to become the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personality inventory (Indicator or MBTI). Since neither were psychologists or psychometricians, they had to start from scratch.  
為了幫助您更好地理解這本書，可能需要一些有關如何編寫這本書的歷史記錄。伊莎貝爾·邁爾斯（Isabel Myers）和她的母親凱瑟琳·庫克·布里格斯（Katharine Cook Briggs）對榮格的理論很感興趣，大約有16年的歷史。第二次世界大戰將許多男人從工業勞動力中吸收出來，使許多婦女脫離了正常工作來代替她們。因為對於這些女性中的大多數來說，繁重的工作場所是一個陌生的新領域，所以我的母親和祖母認為，根據榮格類型理論了解一個人的性格偏好可能會有助於確定戰爭的工作類型沒有先前相關經驗的人可能會感到最舒適和有效。他們徒勞地尋找一個測試或某個人的榮格偏好的指標，並最終決定創建自己的一個。結果就是成為了Myers-Briggs類型指標個性清單（指標或MBTI）。由於既不是心理學家也不是心理學家，所以他們必須從頭開始。  
  
As long as they worked on their own to understand and correlate their observations, they had no problem, but when, in 1943, they produced the first set of questions destined to become the MBTI, they came face-to-face with a double-barreled opposition from the academic community. In the first place, neither was a psychologist, neither had an advanced degree or, for that matter, any formal training in psychology, statics, or test construction. Second,  the academic community (and even the Jungian scholars and analysts at that time)  had little use for Jun’s theory of psychological type, and therefore even less use for a self report questionnaire purporting to identify Jungian type created by two unknown women who were “obviously totally unqualified.” As it happened, however, Isabel Myers was not all that unqualified. True, she had not formal academic training in the required disciplines, but she had a first-class mind and had, for more than a year, apprenticed herself to someone who was a qualified expert in the techniques and tools she needed. That person was Edward N. Hay, at that time personnel manager of a large financial bank in Philadelphia, and from him she learned what she needed to know about test construction, scoring, validation, and statistics.  
只要他們自己努力理解和關聯他們的觀察結果，他們就沒有問題，但是當1943年，他們提出了第一批註定要成為MBTI的問題時，他們面對面提出了雙重質疑。遭到學術界的強烈反對。首先，既沒有心理學家，也沒有高級學位，就此而言，沒有心理學，靜力學或測試結構的任何正式培訓。其次，學術界（甚至當時的榮格學者和分析家）對於君的心理類型理論幾乎沒有用，因此，用於自我報告調查表的用途也更少，該問卷旨在識別由兩名不知名的女性創造的榮格類型。顯然完全沒有資格。”然而，碰巧的是，伊莎貝爾·邁爾斯（Isabel Myers）並非沒有資格。沒錯，她沒有接受必修學科的正規學術培訓，但是她擁有一流的頭腦，並且一年多來一直在培訓自己，她是一位在所需技術和工具方面合格的專家。這個人是愛德華·海（Edward N. Hay），當時是費城一家大型金融銀行的人事經理，從他那裡，她了解了她需要了解的有關測試結構，評分，驗證和統計的知識。  
  
Undismayed by the lack of interest or acceptance by the psychological community, Isabel Myers concentrated on developing the Indicator, gathering data, refining questions, and applying the accepted tests for validity, reliability, repeatability, and statistical significance. Along the way, she was buoyed up by the enthusiasm and delight of the vast majority of people to whom she administered and explained the Indicator, she called it the “aha” reaction, and expression of delight that so often came with a persona’s recognition of some aspect of their personality identified by the Indicator. One of her greatest pleasures in giving feedback after scoring a person’s Indicator was the occasional astonished response: What a relief to find out that it is all right to be me !   
伊莎貝爾·邁爾斯（Isabel Myers）對心理團體的興趣不足或接受並不感到失望，他專注於開髮指標，收集數據，完善問題以及應用有效性，可靠性，可重複性和統計意義的公認測試。 在此過程中，她為自己管理和解釋指標的絕大多數人的熱情和喜悅所鼓舞，她稱其為“啊哈”反應，表達喜悅的過程常常伴隨著角色的認可。 指標確定的人格特徵的某些方面。 她在給一個人的得分打分後給予反饋的最大樂趣之一就是偶爾的驚訝反應：發現做我沒事真是一件輕鬆的事！  
  
Fifty years later, a surprisingly large number of people have experienced, or at least have heard about, the MBTI (over two and one-half million people took it in 1994),  and a number of Jungian concepts have entered our popular vocabulary. For example , extraversion is generally understood as deriving one’s energy from external activity, and introversion as deriving energy from internal activity. An illustration might be: would you rather go out socializing after work or relax alone? For many Extraverts, “hell at a party” is not being able to get in. “Many introverts see it as being here.”  
五十年後，令人驚訝的是，許多人經歷了MBTI，或者至少聽說過MBTI（1994年有超過兩百五十萬的人參加了MBTI），並且許多Jungian概念已經進入了我們流行的詞彙表。 例如，外向通常被理解為從外部活動中獲取能量，而內向被理解為從內部活動中獲取能量。 一個例子可能是：您是下班後還是去社交還是獨自放鬆？ 對於許多外向型人而言，“參加聚會”是無法參加的。“許多內向型人都將其視為在這裡。”  
  
Originally used primarily in one-on-one-counseling, the Indicator has now been widely applied in team building, organization development, business management, education, training, and career counseling. It has been successfully translated into French and Spanish, and translations into almost a dozen other languages are in various stages of validation. Understanding one’s type has made a welcome change in people’s lives in a wide diversity of situations, Through the years since Gifts Differing was first published, there has been overwhelming evidence of its usefulness to individuals in almost every aspect of their work and personal lives. And the usefulness has been well documented.   
該指標最初主要用於一對一諮詢，現已廣泛應用於團隊建設，組織發展，業務管理，教育，培訓和職業諮詢。 它已經成功地翻譯成法文和西班牙文，並且翻譯成將近十二種其他語言的翻譯正處於不同的驗證階段。 了解自己的類型已經在各種各樣的情況下改變了人們的生活，自從《禮物差異》首次出版以來，這些年來，已經有無數的證據表明它對個人在工作和個人生活的幾乎每個方面都是有用的。 有用性已得到充分證明。  
  
 I cherish a personal conviction that much of the nonphysical pain and stress in our world is the result of misunderstandings among generally well-intentioned people and is not occasioned by irreparable disagreements. If this is so, great gains in the quality of everyday life should be possible for each of us through a better understanding of ourselves and of how we gather our information, process it, come to conclusions or decisions, and communicate our thoughts and wishes to others. Greater cooperation and harmony should be possible if we can learn to understand and appreciate the ways in which others differ from ourselves and can find ways to communicate with other in a fashion they can understand and with which they can be comfortable.  
我個人深信，我們世界上許多非身體上的痛苦和壓力是出於善意的人們之間的誤解所造成的，並且不會因無法彌補的分歧而引起。 如果是這樣的話，我們每個人都應該通過更好地了解自己以及我們如何收集信息，處理信息，得出結論或做出決定，並交流我們的想法和願望，從而在日常生活中取得重大成就。 其他。 如果我們能夠學習理解和欣賞他人與自己不同的方式，並找到以他們能夠理解和舒適的方式與他人交流的方式，則應該有可能實現更大的合作與和諧。  
  
Carl Jung wrote of archetypes -- those symbols, myths, and concepts that appear to be inborn and shared by members of a civilization, transcending and not depending on words for communication and recognition. Different cultures may have different forms of their archetypes, but the concepts are universal. If personality type is such a concept, and if it is universal across cultures, religions, and environments, what a challenge lies before us! It could even be possible for the “aha” reaction, experienced upon recognizing something about oneself or the reason for a difference from someone else, to extend to an international family across political and economic borders, in order to bring understanding and respect and acceptance of the differences between people of different nations, races, cultures, and persuasions. Isabel Myers, shortly  before she died, expressed as her fondest wish that long after she was gone, her  work would go on helping people to recognize and enjoy their gifts. I think she would pleased by the increased appreciation of her work fifteen years after her death.  
卡爾·榮格（Carl Jung）所寫的原型就是這些符號，神話和概念，似乎是一個文明成員所固有和共享的，超越，不依賴於交流和認可的詞語。不同的文化可能具有不同的原型形式，但是這些概念是通用的。如果人格類型是一個概念，並且在文化，宗教和環境中普遍存在，那麼挑戰就擺在我們面前！甚至有可能在認識到自己或與他人差異的原因後所經歷的“啊哈”反應擴展到跨越政治和經濟邊界的國際大家庭，以便引起對他人的理解，尊重和接受。不同民族，種族，文化和說服力之間的差異。伊莎貝爾·邁爾斯（Isabel Myers）去世前不久，表達了她最衷心的希望，即她離開後很長一段時間，她的工作將繼續幫助人們認識並享受他們的禮物。我認為，她對去世後十五年的工作越來越欣賞感到滿意。
