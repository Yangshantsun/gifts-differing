# [Why we have this project ? 為何有此專案 ?]
Because it can help more Chinese to understnad the book Gifts Differing. And people can understand themselves and another epople more from this book.  
因為它可以幫助更多的中國人理解《天生不同，了解人格類型》一書。 人們可以從這本書中更多地了解自己和其他人。  
```
因為大陸簡體中文之翻譯與原文欲表達意思仍有語言上的落差，
所以這邊建議讀原文書會比較取得正確觀念。  
Because there is still a linguistic gap between the 
translation of the simplified Chinese in the mainland 
and the original text, it is recommended that reading 
the original book will get the correct concept.  

因為大家不一定有心理學背景或是好的英文基礎，
所以讀起原文書會花上許多時間還不一定能正確。  
Because everyone does not necessarily have a 
psychological background or a good English foundation,
reading the original book will take a lot of time and 
may not be correct.  

為了幫助懂華文的朋友能對於該原文書有好的理解，
成立了這個專案出來。  
In order to help friends who understand Chinese
to have a good understanding of the original book, this 
project was established.  

這個專案可以讓大家一同進行共同翻譯，
藉此可以幫助更多廣大的朋友們了解這本原文書所傳達的意思。  
This project allows everyone to translate together, so 
that it can help more friends understand the meaning of 
this original book.
