# Extension of Jung’s Theory 

CHAPTER 1 PRESENTS the type theory in a less abstruse form than Jung employed in his Psychological Types and states the theory in terms of the everyday aspects seen in well-balanced people. In addition to their dominant process, such people have an auxiliary developed well enough to provide a balance between judgment and perception and between extraversion and introversion. Nowhere in Jung’s book does he describe these normal, balanced types with an auxiliary process at their disposal. He portrays each process in sharpest focus and with maximum contrast between its extraverted and introverted form; consequently, he describes the rare, theoretically “pure” types, who have little or no development of the auxiliary.  

Jung’s approach has several unfortunate effects. By ignoring the auxiliary, he bypasses the combinations of perception and judgment and their broad categories of interest in business, people, language, and science. The results of these combinations -- the everyday forms in which the types are met -- are dismissed in seven lines on page 515 (see page 19 of this book). Consequently, other researchers, who have reinvented the categories under different names, were unaware of the parallels between their findings and jung’s theories.   

Another serious result of ignoring the auxiliary process is the distorted descriptions of the individual introvert types. These types depend on the auxiliary for their extraversion, that is, for their outer personalities, their communication with the world, and their means of taking action. To portray them with no auxiliary is to portray them with no extraversion -- unable to communicate, to use their insights, or to have any impact on the outer world.  

In view of Jung’s deep appreciation of the introverts’ value, it is ironical that he lets his passion for the abstract betray him into concentrating on cases of “pure” introversion. He not only describes people with no extraversion at all, but seems to present them as typical of introverts in general. By failing to convey that introverts with a good auxiliary are effective and play an indispensable part in the world, he opens the door for a general misunderstanding of his theory. Many people so completely misunderstood it that they took the basic extravert-introvert difference to be a difference in adjustment instead of a legitimate choice of orientation.  

Few of Jung’s readers appear to have realized that his type concepts had a bearing on the familiar daily problem of educating people, counseling them, employing them, communicating with them, and living in the same family with them. For decades, therefore, the practical utility of his theory went unexplored.
