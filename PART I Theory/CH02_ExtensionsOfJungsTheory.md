# Extension of Jung’s Theory 榮格理論的延伸

CHAPTER 1 PRESENTS the type theory in a less abstruse form than Jung employed in his Psychological Types and states the theory in terms of the everyday aspects seen in well-balanced people. In addition to their dominant process, such people have an auxiliary developed well enough to provide a balance between judgment and perception and between extraversion and introversion. Nowhere in Jung’s book does he describe these normal, balanced types with an auxiliary process at their disposal. He portrays each process in sharpest focus and with maximum contrast between its extraverted and introverted form; consequently, he describes the rare, theoretically “pure” types, who have little or no development of the auxiliary.  
第一章以比榮格在《心理類型》中所採用的抽象形式少的粗俗的形式提出類型理論，並以均衡的人的日常狀況來陳述該理論。這些人除了占主導地位的過程外，還具有足夠的輔助能力，可以在判斷和知覺之間以及外向和內向之間取得平衡。在榮格的書中，他都沒有描述這些正常，平衡的類型，並輔以輔助處理。他以最清晰的視角描繪每個過程，並在其外向和內向形式之間形成最大的對比。因此，他描述了罕見的，理論上“純”的類型，它們很少或沒有輔助劑的開發。(Google 翻譯)  

Jung’s approach has several unfortunate effects. By ignoring the auxiliary, he bypasses the combinations of perception and judgment and their broad categories of interest in business, people, language, and science. The results of these combinations -- the everyday forms in which the types are met -- are dismissed in seven lines on page 515 (see page 19 of this book). Consequently, other researchers, who have reinvented the categories under different names, were unaware of the parallels between their findings and jung’s theories.   
榮格的方法有幾個不幸的影響。通過忽略輔助因素，他繞過了感知和判斷以及他們對商業，人員，語言和科學的廣泛興趣類別的組合。這些組合的結果-滿足類型的日常形式-在第515頁的七行中消除（請參閱本書第19頁）。因此，其他以不同名稱重新發明了類別的研究人員卻沒有意識到他們的發現與榮格理論之間的相似之處。(Google 翻譯)  

Another serious result of ignoring the auxiliary process is the distorted descriptions of the individual introvert types. These types depend on the auxiliary for their extraversion, that is, for their outer personalities, their communication with the world, and their means of taking action. To portray them with no auxiliary is to portray them with no extraversion -- unable to communicate, to use their insights, or to have any impact on the outer world.  
忽略輔助過程的另一個嚴重結果是各個內向型類型的描述失真。這些類型取決於助教的外向性，即他們的外在個性，與世界的交流以及採取行動的方式。在沒有輔助的情況下刻畫他們就是在沒有外向性的情況下刻畫他們-無法交流，使用他們的見解或對外部世界有任何影響。(Google 翻譯)  

In view of Jung’s deep appreciation of the introverts’ value, it is ironical that he lets his passion for the abstract betray him into concentrating on cases of “pure” introversion. He not only describes people with no extraversion at all, but seems to present them as typical of introverts in general. By failing to convey that introverts with a good auxiliary are effective and play an indispensable part in the world, he opens the door for a general misunderstanding of his theory. Many people so completely misunderstood it that they took the basic extravert-introvert difference to be a difference in adjustment instead of a legitimate choice of orientation.  
鑑於榮格對內向型人的價值的深刻理解，具有諷刺意味的是，他讓對抽象的熱情背叛了他，專注於“純粹”性格內向的案例。他不僅描述了完全沒有外向的人，而且似乎將他們呈現為一般內向的人。由於未能傳達出內向的內向者有效而有效，並在世界上起著不可或缺的作用，因此他為普遍的理論誤解打開了大門。許多人完全誤解了這一點，以至於他們將基本的內向與內向差異視為調整差異，而不是對方向的合理選擇。(Google 翻譯)  

Few of Jung’s readers appear to have realized that his type concepts had a bearing on the familiar daily problem of educating people, counseling them, employing them, communicating with them, and living in the same family with them. For decades, therefore, the practical utility of his theory went unexplored.  
榮格（Jung）的讀者中很少有人意識到他的類型概念與人們日常的教育問題有關，即教育人們，向他們提供諮詢，僱用他們，與他們交流以及與他們同居。因此，幾十年來，他的理論的實際應用一直未被探索。(Google 翻譯)  

## Overlooked Implications of Jung’s Theory  

To be useful, a personality theory must portray and explain people as they are. Jung’s theory must, therefore, be extended to include the following three essentials.  

## Constant Presence of the Auxiliary Process 

## Results of the Combinations of Perception and Judgment  

## Role of the Auxiliary in Balancing Extraversion-Introversion  

## The Resulting Sixteen Types  

## The Role of the Judgment-Perception Preference  

## Reality of the Opposites
