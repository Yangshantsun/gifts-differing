# An Orderly Reason for Personality Differences

It is fashionable to say that the individual is unique. Each is the product of his or her own heredity and environment and, therefore, is different from everyone else. From a practical standpoint, however, the doctrine of uniqueness is not useful without an exhaustive case study of every person to be educated or counseled or understood. Yet we cannot safely assume that other people’s minds work on the same principles as our own. All too often, others with whom we come in contact do not reason as we reason, or do not value the thins we value, or are not interested in what interests us.    
現在很流行地說每個人都是獨一無二的。每個都是他或她自己的遺傳和環境的產物，因此，這世界上絕不存在兩個完全相同的人。但是，從實踐的角度來看，如果沒有對每個人進行詳盡的案例研究，就不能對唯一性原則有用。但是，我們不能安全地假設別人的思想與我們自己的思想相同。通常，與我們接觸的其他人不會像我們那樣推理，或者不珍惜我們珍視的東西，或者對我們感興趣的東西不感興趣。(Google翻)  
  
The merit of the theory presented here is that it enables us to expect specific personality differences in particular people and to cope with the people and the differences in a constructive way. Briefly, the theory is that much seemingly chance variation in human behavior is not due to chance; it is in fact the logical result of a few basic, observable differences in mental functioning.  
這裡介紹的理論的優點在於，它使我們能夠期待特定人的特定人格差異，並以建設性的方式應對人與人之間的差異。簡而言之，該理論認為，人類行為中看似偶然的變化並不是偶然的。實際上，這是心理功能上一些基本的，可觀察到的差異的邏輯結果。(Google翻)  
  
These basic differences concern the way people prefer to use their minds, specifically, the way they perceive and the way they make judgments. Perceiving is here understood to include the processes of becoming aware of things, people, occurrences, and ideas. Judging includes the processes of coming to conclusions about what has been perceived. Together, perception and judgment, which make up a large portion of people’s total mental activity,  govern much of their outer behavior, because perception -- by definition -- determines what people see in a situation, and their judgment determines what they decide to do about it. Thus, it is reasonable that basic differences in perception or judgment should result in corresponding differences in behavior.  
這些基本差異關係到人們喜歡使用思想的方式，特別是他們的感知方式和做出判斷的方式。在這裡，感知被理解為包括對事物，人，事件和思想的認識的過程。評判包括就所感知的事物得出結論的過程。感知和判斷共同構成了人們總體心理活動的很大一部分，支配著他們的許多外在行為，因為感知（根據定義）決定了人們在某種情況下所看到的東西，而判斷則決定了他們決定要做的事情關於它。因此，合理的認識或判斷上的差異應導致相應的行為差異。(Google 翻)  

## Two Ways of Perceiving 感知功能有兩種

As Jung points out in Psychological Types, humankind is equipped with two distinct and sharply contrasting ways of perceiving. One means of perception is the familiar process of sensing, by which we become aware of things directly through our five senses. The other is the process of intuition, which is indirect perception by way of the unconscious, incorporating ideas or associations that the unconscious tacks on to perceptions coming from outside. These unconscious contributions range from the merest masculine “hunch” or “woman’s intuition” to the crowning examples of creative art or scientific discovery.
正如榮格在《心理類型》中指出的那樣，人類擁有兩種截然不同且截然相反的感知方式。感知的一種方法是熟悉的感知過程，通過它我們可以通過五種感覺直接感知事物。另一個是直覺的過程，它是通過無意識的方式進行的間接感知，並結合了無意識對來自外部的感知的想法或聯想。這些無意識的貢獻從最男性化的“預感”或“女性的直覺”到創造性藝術或科學發現的最高典範。(Google翻)

The existence of distinct ways of perceiving would seem self-evident.  People perceive through their senses, and they also perceive things that are not and never have been present to their senses. The theory adds the suggestion that the two kinds of perception compete for a person’s attention and that most people, from infancy up, enjoy one more than the other. When people prefer sensing, they are so interested in the actuality around them that they have little attention to spare for ideas coming faintly out of nowhere. Those people who prefer intuition are so engrossed in pursuing the possibilities it presents that they seldom look very intently at the actualities. For instance, readers who prefer sensing will tend to confine their attention to what is said here on the page. Readers who prefer intuition are likely to read between and beyond the lines to the possibilities that come to mind.
存在不同的感知方式似乎是不言而喻的。人們通過自己的感官來感知，他們也可以感知那些從來沒有出現過的東西。該理論增加了一種建議，即兩種感知力爭奪一個人的注意力，並且大多數人從嬰儿期開始就比另一種享有更多的享受。當人們更喜歡感知時，他們對周圍的現實非常感興趣，以至於他們幾乎沒有註意力去避開那些虛幻的想法。那些喜歡直覺的人全神貫注於追求它所帶來的可能性，因此他們很少非常專心地看待現實。例如，喜歡感應的讀者會傾向於將注意力集中在頁面上的講話中。那些喜歡直覺的讀者可能會在可能出現的界限之間或之外閱讀。(Google翻)


As soon as children exercise a preference between the two ways of perceiving, a basic difference in development begins. The children have enough command of their mental processes to be able to use the favorite processes more often and to neglect the processes they enjoy less. Whichever process they prefer, whether sensing or intuition, they will use more, paying closer attention to its stream of impressions and fashioning their idea of the world from what the process reveals. The other kind of perception  will be background, a little out of focus.
一旦孩子在兩種感知方式之間選擇了偏愛，發育方面的基本差異就會開始。孩子們對自己的心理過程有足夠的控制能力，可以更多地使用自己喜歡的過程，而忽略了自己所享受的過程。無論他們喜歡哪個過程，無論是感知還是直覺，他們都將更多地使用它，密切關注它的印象流，並根據過程所揭示的內容塑造他們對世界的看法。另一種看法將是背景，有點模糊。(Google翻)

With the advantage of constant practice, the preferred process grows more controlled and more trustworthy. The children become more adult in their use of the preferred process than in their less frequent use of the neglected one. Their enjoyment extends from the process itself to activities requiring the process, and they tend to develop the surface traits that result from looking at life in a particular way. 
憑藉不斷實踐的優勢，首選過程變得更加可控且更可信賴。與不經常使用被忽視的孩子相比，兒童在使用首選方法時變得更加成人。他們的樂趣從過程本身擴展到需要過程的活動，並且他們傾向於發展以特定方式看待生活所產生的表面特徵。(Google翻)

Thus, by a natural sequence of events, the child who prefers sensing and the child who prefers intuition develop along divergent lines. Each becomes relatively adult in an area where the other remains relatively childlike. Both channel their interests and energy into activities that give them a chance to use their mind the way they prefer. Both acquire a set of surface traits that grows out of the basic preferences beneath. This is the SN preference: S for sensing and N for intuition.
因此，通過自然的事件序列，喜歡感知的孩子和喜歡直覺的孩子會沿著分歧的方向發展。在彼此保持相對童年的地區，每個人都相對成年。雙方都將自己的興趣和精力投入到活動中，使他們有機會以自己喜歡的方式使用自己的思想。兩者都獲得了一系列表面特徵，這些特徵是從下面的基本偏好中衍生出來的。這是SN偏好：S代表感應，N代表直覺。(Google翻)

## Two Ways of Judging 判斷功能有兩種

A basic difference in judgment arises from the existence of two distinct and sharply contrasting ways of coming to conclusions. One way is by the use of thinking, that is, by a logical process, aimed at an impersonal finding. The other is by feeling, that is, by appreciation -- equally reasonable in its fashion -- bestowing on things a personal, subjective value.  
判斷的基本差異是由兩種截然不同且截然相反的結論得出的。一種方法是通過使用思維，即通過針對非個人發現的邏輯過程。另一種是通過感覺，也就是通過欣賞（在形式上同樣合理），賦予事物一種個人的，主觀的價值。(Google翻)  
  
These two ways of judging would also seem self-evident. Most people would agree that they make some decisions with thinking and some with feeling, and that the two methods do not always reach the same result from a given set of facts. The theory suggest that a person is almost certain to enjoy and trust one way of judging more than the other. In judging the ideas presented here, a reader who considers first whether they are consistent and logical is using thinking judgment.  A reader who is conscious first that the ideas are pleasing or displeasing, supporting or threatening ideas already prized, is using feeling judgment.  
這兩種判斷方法似乎也是不言而喻的。大多數人會同意，他們用思想做出某些決定，而用感覺做出某些決定，並且這兩種方法並不總是從給定的事實集合中得出相同的結果。該理論表明，一個人幾乎肯定會喜歡和信任一種判斷方式，而不是另一種。在判斷此處提出的想法時，首先考慮思想是否一致且合乎邏輯的讀者正在使用思維判斷。首先意識到想法是令人愉悅或不悅，支持或威脅已經珍視的想法的讀者正在使用感覺判斷。(Google翻)  
  
Whichever judging process a child prefers he or she will use more often, trust more implicitly, and be much more ready to obey. The other kind of judgment will be a sort of minority opinion, half-heard and often wholly disregarded.  
無論孩子喜歡哪個判斷過程，他或她都會更頻繁地使用，更隱含地信任並且更願意服從。另一種判斷將是一種少數意見，是半聽卻常常被完全忽視的。(Google翻)  
  
Thus, the child who prefers thinking develops along divergent lines from the child who prefers feeling, even when both like the same perceptive process and start with the same perceptions. Both are happier and more effective in activities that call for the sort of judgments that they are better equipped to make. The child who prefers feeling becomes more adult in the handling of human relationships. The child who prefers thinking grows more adept in the organization of facts and ideas. Their basic preference for the personal or the impersonal approach to life results in distinguishing surface traits. This is the TF preference: T for thinking and F for feeling.  
因此，即使他們都喜歡相同的感知過程並以相同的感知開始，但喜歡思考的孩子卻與喜歡感覺的孩子沿著分歧的方向發展。兩者在需要更好地做出判斷的活動中都更快樂，更有效。喜歡情感的孩子在處理人際關係時變得更加成人。喜歡思考的孩子會更擅長事實和思想的組織。他們對生活的個人或非個人方法的基本偏愛導致區分錶面特徵。這就是TF偏好：T代表思考，F代表感覺。(Google翻)  
  
## Combinations of Perception and judgment  
The TF preference (thinking or feeling) is entirely independent of the SN preference (sensing or intuition). Either kind of judgment can team up with either kind of perception. Thus, four combinations occur:  
TF偏好（思考或情感）完全獨立於SN偏好（感覺或直覺）。 每種判斷都可以與任何一種感知結合在一起。 因此，出現四種組合：(Google 翻)

- ST Sensing plus thinking
- SF Sensing plus feeling
- NF Intuition plus feeling
- NT Intuition plus thinking  

Each of these combinations produces a different kind of personality, characterized by the interests,  values, needs, habits of mind, and surface traits that naturally result from the combination. Combinations with a common preference will share some qualities, but each combination has qualities all its own, arising from the interaction of the preferred way of looking at life and the preferred way of judging what is seen. 
這些組合中的每一種都會產生不同類型的個性，其特徵是組合所自然產生的興趣，價值，需求，思維習慣和表面特徵。具有共同偏愛的組合將具有某些特質，但是每種組合都具有其自身的特質，這源於對生活的偏愛和判斷事物的偏好。(Google 翻)

Whatever a person's particular combination of preferences may be, others with the same combination are apt to be the easiest to understand and like. They will tend to have similar interests, since they share the same kind of perception, and to consider the same things important, since they share the same kind of judgment. 
無論一個人的特定偏好組合是什麼，具有相同組合的其他人都傾向於最容易理解和喜歡。由於他們具有相同的看法，因此他們傾向於具有相似的興趣，並且由於他們具有相同的判斷力，因此他們將認為相同的事情很重要。(Google 翻)

On the other hand, people who differ on both preferences will be hard to understand and hard to predict --except that on every debatable question they are likely to take opposite stands. If these very opposite people are merely acquaintances, the clash of views may not matter, but if they are co-workers, close associates, or members of the same family, the constant opposition can be a strain. 
另一方面，兩種偏好不同的人將很難理解和預測-除了在每個有爭議的問題上他們可能會採取相反的立場。如果這些非常對立的人僅僅是熟人，則意見衝突可能並不重要，但是如果他們是同事，親密同事或同一個家庭的成員，則持續不斷的反對可能會成為一種壓力。(Google 翻)

Many destructive conflicts arise simply because two people are using opposite kinds of perception and judgment. When the origin  of such a conflict is recognized, it becomes less annoying and easier to handle.
許多破壞性衝突的產生僅僅是因為兩個人正在使用相反的感知和判斷力。當識別出這種衝突的根源時，它就變得不那麼煩人並且更易於處理。(Google 翻)

An even more destructive conflict may exist between people and their jobs, when the job makes no use of the worker's natural combination of perception  and judgment but constantly demands the opposite combination. 
當工作沒有利用工人的感知和判斷力的自然組合，而是不斷要求相反的組合時，人們與工作之間可能存在更具破壞性的衝突。(Google 翻)

The following paragraphs sketch the contrasting personalities that are expected in theory and found in practice to result from each of the four possible combinations of perception and judgment.
以下各段簡要介紹了理論上所期望並在實踐中發現的兩種截然不同的個性，這些個性是由感知和判斷的四種可能組合中的每一種產生的。(Google 翻)

### Sensing Plus Thinking    

The ST(sensing plus thinking) people rely primarily on sensing for purposes of perception and on thinking for purposes of judgment. Thus, their main interest focuses upon facts, because facts can be collected and verified directly by the senses -- by seeing, hearing touching, counting, weighing,  measuring. ST people approach their decisions regarding these facts by impersonal analysis, because of their trust in thinking, with its step-by-step logical process of reasoning from cause to effect,  from premise to conclusion.  

In consequence, their personalities tend to be practical and matter-of-fact, and their best chances of success and satisfaction lie in fields that demand impersonal analysis of concrete facts, such as economics, law, surgery, business, accounting, production,  and the handling of machines and materials.  


### Sensing Plus Feeling  

The SF (sensing plus feeling) people, too, rely primarily on sensing for purposes of perception, but they prefer feeling for purposes of judgment. They approach their decisions with personal warmth because their feeling weighs how much things matter to themselves and others.  

They are more interested in facts about people than in facts about things and, therefore, they tend to be sociable and friendly. They are more likely to succeed and be satisfied in work where their personal warmth can be applied effectively to the immediate situation, as in pediatrics, nursing, teaching (especially elementary), social work, selling of tangibles, and service-with-a-smile jobs.  

### Intuition Plus Feeling  

The NF (intuition plus feeling) people possess the same personal warmth as SF people because of their shared use of feeling for purposes of judgment, but because the NFs prefer intuition to sensing, they do not center their attention upon the concrete situation. Instead they focus on possibilities,  such as new projects (things that haven’t ever happened but might be made to happen) or new truths (things that are not yet known but might be found out). The new project or the new truth is imagined by the unconscious processes and then intuitively perceived as an idea that feels like an inspiration.  

The personal warmth and commitment with which the NF people seek and follow up a possibility are impressive. They are both enthusiastic and insightful. Often they have a marked gift of language and can communicate both the possibility  they see and the value they attach to it. They are more likely to find success and satisfaction in work that calls for creativity to meet a human need. They may excel in teaching (particularly college and high school), preaching, advertising, selling of intangibles, counseling, clinical psychology, psychiatry, writing,  and most fields of research.   


### Intuition Plus Thinking  

The NT (intuition plus thinking) people also use intuition but team it with thinking.  Although they focus on a possibility, they approach it with impersonal analysis. Often they choose a theoretical or executive possibility and subordinate the human element.   

NTs tend to be logical and ingenious and are most successful in solving problems in a field of special interest, whether scientific research, electronic computing mathematics, the more complex aspects of finance, or any sort of development or pioneering in technical areas.  

Everyone has probably met all four kinds of people: ST people, who are practical and matter-of-fact; the sympathetic and friendly SF people. NF people, who are characterized by their enthusiasm and insight; and NT people, who are logical and ingenious.  

The skeptic may ask how four apparently basic categories of people could have gone unnoticed in the past. The answer is that the categories  have been noted repeatedly and by different investigators or theorists.   

Vernon (1938) cited three systems of classification derived by different methods but which are strikingly parallel. Each reflects the combinations of perception and judgment: Thurstone (1931), by factor analysis of vocational interest scores, found four main factors corresponding to interest in business,  in people, in language, and in science; Gundlach and Gerum (1931), from inspection of interest intercorrelations,  deduced five main “type of ability,” namely, technical, social, creative, and intellectual, plus physical skill; Spranger (1928), from logical and intuitive considerations, derived six “types of men,” namely, economic, social religious, and theoretical, plus aesthetic and political.  


## The Extraversion-Introversion Preference  

Another basic difference in people’s use of perception and judgment arises from their relative interest in their outer and inner worlds. Introversion, in the sense given to it by Jung in formulating the term and the idea, is one of two complementary orientations to life; its complement is extraversion. The introvert’s main interests are in the inner world of concepts and ideas, while the extravert is more involved with the outer world of people and things. Therefore, when circumstances permit, the introvert concentrates perception and judgment upon ideas, while the extravert likes to focus them on the outside environment.   

This is not to say that anyone is limited either to the inner world or to the outer. Well-developed introverts can deal ably with the world or to the outer. Well-developed introverts can deal ably with the world around them when necessary, but they do their best work inside their heads, in reflection. Similarly well-developed extraverts can deal effectively with ideas, but they do their best work externally, in action. For both kinds, the natural preference remains,  like right of left-handedness.  

For example, some readers, who would like to get to the practical applications of this theory, are looking at it from the extravert standpoint. Other readers, who feel more interest in the insight that the theory may provide for understanding themselves and human nature in general, are seeing it from the introvert point of view.   

Sing the EI preference (extraversion or introversion) is completely independent of the SN and TF preferences, extraverts and introverts may have any of the four combinations of perception and judgment. For example, among the STs, the introverts (IST) organize the facts and principles related to a situation; this approach is useful in economics or law. The extraverts (EST) organize the situation itself, including any idle by standers, and get things rolling, which is useful in business and industry. Things usually move faster for the extraverts; things move in a more considered direction for the introverts.    

Among the NF people, the introverts (INF) work out their insights slowly and carefully, searching for eternal verities. The extraverts (ENF) have an urge to communicate and put their inspirations into practice. If the extraverts’ results are more extensive, the introverts’ maybe more profound.  


## The Judgment-Perception Preference  

One more preference enters into the identification of type -- the choice between the perceptive attitude and the judging attitude as a way of life, a method of dealing with the world around us. Although people must of course use both perception and judgment, both cannot be used at the same moment. So people shift back and forth between the perceptive and judging attitudes, sometimes quite abruptly, as when a parent with a high tolerance for children’s noise suddenly decides that enough is enough.   

There is a time to perceive and a time to judge, and many times when either attitude might be appropriate. Most people find one attitude more comfortable than the other, feel more at home in it, and use it as often as possible in dealing with the outer world. For example, some readers are still following this explanation with an open mind; they are, at least for the moment, using perception. Other readers have decided by now that they agree or disagree; they are using judgment.   

There is a fundamental opposition between the two attitudes. In order to come to a conclusion, people use the judging attitude and have to shut off perception for the time being. All the evidence is in, and anything more is irrelevant and immaterial. The time has come to arrive at a verdict. Conversely, in the perceptive attitude people shut off judgment. Not all the evidence is in; new developments will occur. It is much too soon to do anything irrevocable.   

This preference makes the difference between the judging people, who order their lives, and the perceptive people, who just live them. Both attitudes have merit. Either can make a satisfying way of life, if a person can switch temporarily to the opposite attitude when it is really needed.
