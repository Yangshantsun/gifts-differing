# An Orderly Reason for Personality Differences

It is fashionable to say that the individual is unique. Each is the product of his or her own heredity and environment and, therefore, is different from everyone else. From a practical standpoint, however, the doctrine of uniqueness is not useful without an exhaustive case study of every person to be educated or counseled or understood. Yet we cannot safely assume that other people’s minds work on the same principles as our own. All too often, others with whom we come in contact do not reason as we reason, or do not value the thins we value, or are not interested in what interests us.    
現在很流行地說每個人都是獨一無二的。每個都是他或她自己的遺傳和環境的產物，因此，這世界上絕不存在兩個完全相同的人。但是，從實踐的角度來看，如果沒有對每個人進行詳盡的案例研究，就不能對唯一性原則有用。但是，我們不能安全地假設別人的思想與我們自己的思想相同。通常，與我們接觸的其他人不會像我們那樣推理，或者不珍惜我們珍視的東西，或者對我們感興趣的東西不感興趣。(Google翻)  
  
The merit of the theory presented here is that it enables us to expect specific personality differences in particular people and to cope with the people and the differences in a constructive way. Briefly, the theory is that much seemingly chance variation in human behavior is not due to chance; it is in fact the logical result of a few basic, observable differences in mental functioning.  
這裡介紹的理論的優點在於，它使我們能夠期待特定人的特定人格差異，並以建設性的方式應對人與人之間的差異。簡而言之，該理論認為，人類行為中看似偶然的變化並不是偶然的。實際上，這是心理功能上一些基本的，可觀察到的差異的邏輯結果。(Google翻)  
  
These basic differences concern the way people prefer to use their minds, specifically, the way they perceive and the way they make judgments. Perceiving is here understood to include the processes of becoming aware of things, people, occurrences, and ideas. Judging includes the processes of coming to conclusions about what has been perceived. Together, perception and judgment, which make up a large portion of people’s total mental activity,  govern much of their outer behavior, because perception -- by definition -- determines what people see in a situation, and their judgment determines what they decide to do about it. Thus, it is reasonable that basic differences in perception or judgment should result in corresponding differences in behavior.  
這些基本差異關係到人們喜歡使用思想的方式，特別是他們的感知方式和做出判斷的方式。在這裡，感知被理解為包括對事物，人，事件和思想的認識的過程。評判包括就所感知的事物得出結論的過程。感知和判斷共同構成了人們總體心理活動的很大一部分，支配著他們的許多外在行為，因為感知（根據定義）決定了人們在某種情況下所看到的東西，而判斷則決定了他們決定要做的事情關於它。因此，合理的認識或判斷上的差異應導致相應的行為差異。(Google 翻)  

## Two Ways of Perceiving 感知功能有兩種

As Jung points out in Psychological Types, humankind is equipped with two distinct and sharply contrasting ways of perceiving. One means of perception is the familiar process of sensing, by which we become aware of things directly through our five senses. The other is the process of intuition, which is indirect perception by way of the unconscious, incorporating ideas or associations that the unconscious tacks on to perceptions coming from outside. These unconscious contributions range from the merest masculine “hunch” or “woman’s intuition” to the crowning examples of creative art or scientific discovery.
正如榮格在《心理類型》中指出的那樣，人類擁有兩種截然不同且截然相反的感知方式。感知的一種方法是熟悉的感知過程，通過它我們可以通過五種感覺直接感知事物。另一個是直覺的過程，它是通過無意識的方式進行的間接感知，並結合了無意識對來自外部的感知的想法或聯想。這些無意識的貢獻從最男性化的“預感”或“女性的直覺”到創造性藝術或科學發現的最高典範。(Google翻)

The existence of distinct ways of perceiving would seem self-evident.  People perceive through their senses, and they also perceive things that are not and never have been present to their senses. The theory adds the suggestion that the two kinds of perception compete for a person’s attention and that most people, from infancy up, enjoy one more than the other. When people prefer sensing, they are so interested in the actuality around them that they have little attention to spare for ideas coming faintly out of nowhere. Those people who prefer intuition are so engrossed in pursuing the possibilities it presents that they seldom look very intently at the actualities. For instance, readers who prefer sensing will tend to confine their attention to what is said here on the page. Readers who prefer intuition are likely to read between and beyond the lines to the possibilities that come to mind.
存在不同的感知方式似乎是不言而喻的。人們通過自己的感官來感知，他們也可以感知那些從來沒有出現過的東西。該理論增加了一種建議，即兩種感知力爭奪一個人的注意力，並且大多數人從嬰儿期開始就比另一種享有更多的享受。當人們更喜歡感知時，他們對周圍的現實非常感興趣，以至於他們幾乎沒有註意力去避開那些虛幻的想法。那些喜歡直覺的人全神貫注於追求它所帶來的可能性，因此他們很少非常專心地看待現實。例如，喜歡感應的讀者會傾向於將注意力集中在頁面上的講話中。那些喜歡直覺的讀者可能會在可能出現的界限之間或之外閱讀。(Google翻)


As soon as children exercise a preference between the two ways of perceiving, a basic difference in development begins. The children have enough command of their mental processes to be able to use the favorite processes more often and to neglect the processes they enjoy less. Whichever process they prefer, whether sensing or intuition, they will use more, paying closer attention to its stream of impressions and fashioning their idea of the world from what the process reveals. The other kind of perception  will be background, a little out of focus.
一旦孩子在兩種感知方式之間選擇了偏愛，發育方面的基本差異就會開始。孩子們對自己的心理過程有足夠的控制能力，可以更多地使用自己喜歡的過程，而忽略了自己所享受的過程。無論他們喜歡哪個過程，無論是感知還是直覺，他們都將更多地使用它，密切關注它的印象流，並根據過程所揭示的內容塑造他們對世界的看法。另一種看法將是背景，有點模糊。(Google翻)

With the advantage of constant practice, the preferred process grows more controlled and more trustworthy. The children become more adult in their use of the preferred process than in their less frequent use of the neglected one. Their enjoyment extends from the process itself to activities requiring the process, and they tend to develop the surface traits that result from looking at life in a particular way. 
憑藉不斷實踐的優勢，首選過程變得更加可控且更可信賴。與不經常使用被忽視的孩子相比，兒童在使用首選方法時變得更加成人。他們的樂趣從過程本身擴展到需要過程的活動，並且他們傾向於發展以特定方式看待生活所產生的表面特徵。(Google翻)

Thus, by a natural sequence of events, the child who prefers sensing and the child who prefers intuition develop along divergent lines. Each becomes relatively adult in an area where the other remains relatively childlike. Both channel their interests and energy into activities that give them a chance to use their mind the way they prefer. Both acquire a set of surface traits that grows out of the basic preferences beneath. This is the SN preference: S for sensing and N for intuition.
因此，通過自然的事件序列，喜歡感知的孩子和喜歡直覺的孩子會沿著分歧的方向發展。在彼此保持相對童年的地區，每個人都相對成年。雙方都將自己的興趣和精力投入到活動中，使他們有機會以自己喜歡的方式使用自己的思想。兩者都獲得了一系列表面特徵，這些特徵是從下面的基本偏好中衍生出來的。這是SN偏好：S代表感應，N代表直覺。(Google翻)

## Two Ways of Judging 判斷功能有兩種

A basic difference in judgment arises from the existence of two distinct and sharply contrasting ways of coming to conclusions. One way is by the use of thinking, that is, by a logical process, aimed at an impersonal finding. The other is by feeling, that is, by appreciation -- equally reasonable in its fashion -- bestowing on things a personal, subjective value.  
判斷的基本差異是由兩種截然不同且截然相反的結論得出的。一種方法是通過使用思維，即通過針對非個人發現的邏輯過程。另一種是通過感覺，也就是通過欣賞（在形式上同樣合理），賦予事物一種個人的，主觀的價值。(Google翻)  
  
These two ways of judging would also seem self-evident. Most people would agree that they make some decisions with thinking and some with feeling, and that the two methods do not always reach the same result from a given set of facts. The theory suggest that a person is almost certain to enjoy and trust one way of judging more than the other. In judging the ideas presented here, a reader who considers first whether they are consistent and logical is using thinking judgment.  A reader who is conscious first that the ideas are pleasing or displeasing, supporting or threatening ideas already prized, is using feeling judgment.  
這兩種判斷方法似乎也是不言而喻的。大多數人會同意，他們用思想做出某些決定，而用感覺做出某些決定，並且這兩種方法並不總是從給定的事實集合中得出相同的結果。該理論表明，一個人幾乎肯定會喜歡和信任一種判斷方式，而不是另一種。在判斷此處提出的想法時，首先考慮思想是否一致且合乎邏輯的讀者正在使用思維判斷。首先意識到想法是令人愉悅或不悅，支持或威脅已經珍視的想法的讀者正在使用感覺判斷。(Google翻)  
  
Whichever judging process a child prefers he or she will use more often, trust more implicitly, and be much more ready to obey. The other kind of judgment will be a sort of minority opinion, half-heard and often wholly disregarded.  
無論孩子喜歡哪個判斷過程，他或她都會更頻繁地使用，更隱含地信任並且更願意服從。另一種判斷將是一種少數意見，是半聽卻常常被完全忽視的。(Google翻)  
  
Thus, the child who prefers thinking develops along divergent lines from the child who prefers feeling, even when both like the same perceptive process and start with the same perceptions. Both are happier and more effective in activities that call for the sort of judgments that they are better equipped to make. The child who prefers feeling becomes more adult in the handling of human relationships. The child who prefers thinking grows more adept in the organization of facts and ideas. Their basic preference for the personal or the impersonal approach to life results in distinguishing surface traits. This is the TF preference: T for thinking and F for feeling.  
因此，即使他們都喜歡相同的感知過程並以相同的感知開始，但喜歡思考的孩子卻與喜歡感覺的孩子沿著分歧的方向發展。兩者在需要更好地做出判斷的活動中都更快樂，更有效。喜歡情感的孩子在處理人際關係時變得更加成人。喜歡思考的孩子會更擅長事實和思想的組織。他們對生活的個人或非個人方法的基本偏愛導致區分錶面特徵。這就是TF偏好：T代表思考，F代表感覺。(Google翻)  
  
## Combinations of Perception and judgment  
The TF preference (thinking or feeling) is entirely independent of the SN preference (sensing or intuition). Either kind of judgment can team up with either kind of perception. Thus, four combinations occur:  
TF偏好（思考或情感）完全獨立於SN偏好（感覺或直覺）。 每種判斷都可以與任何一種感知結合在一起。 因此，出現四種組合：(Google 翻)

- ST Sensing plus thinking
- SF Sensing plus feeling
- NF Intuition plus feeling
- NT Intuition plus thinking  

Each of these combinations produces a different kind of personality, characterized by the interests,  values, needs, habits of mind, and surface traits that naturally result from the combination. Combinations with a common preference will share some qualities, but each combination has qualities all its own, arising from the interaction of the preferred way of looking at life and the preferred way of judging what is seen. 
這些組合中的每一種都會產生不同類型的個性，其特徵是組合所自然產生的興趣，價值，需求，思維習慣和表面特徵。具有共同偏愛的組合將具有某些特質，但是每種組合都具有其自身的特質，這源於對生活的偏愛和判斷事物的偏好。(Google 翻)

Whatever a person's particular combination of preferences may be, others with the same combination are apt to be the easiest to understand and like. They will tend to have similar interests, since they share the same kind of perception, and to consider the same things important, since they share the same kind of judgment. 
無論一個人的特定偏好組合是什麼，具有相同組合的其他人都傾向於最容易理解和喜歡。由於他們具有相同的看法，因此他們傾向於具有相似的興趣，並且由於他們具有相同的判斷力，因此他們將認為相同的事情很重要。(Google 翻)

On the other hand, people who differ on both preferences will be hard to understand and hard to predict --except that on every debatable question they are likely to take opposite stands. If these very opposite people are merely acquaintances, the clash of views may not matter, but if they are co-workers, close associates, or members of the same family, the constant opposition can be a strain. 
另一方面，兩種偏好不同的人將很難理解和預測-除了在每個有爭議的問題上他們可能會採取相反的立場。如果這些非常對立的人僅僅是熟人，則意見衝突可能並不重要，但是如果他們是同事，親密同事或同一個家庭的成員，則持續不斷的反對可能會成為一種壓力。(Google 翻)

Many destructive conflicts arise simply because two people are using opposite kinds of perception and judgment. When the origin  of such a conflict is recognized, it becomes less annoying and easier to handle.
許多破壞性衝突的產生僅僅是因為兩個人正在使用相反的感知和判斷力。當識別出這種衝突的根源時，它就變得不那麼煩人並且更易於處理。(Google 翻)

An even more destructive conflict may exist between people and their jobs, when the job makes no use of the worker's natural combination of perception  and judgment but constantly demands the opposite combination. 
當工作沒有利用工人的感知和判斷力的自然組合，而是不斷要求相反的組合時，人們與工作之間可能存在更具破壞性的衝突。(Google 翻)

The following paragraphs sketch the contrasting personalities that are expected in theory and found in practice to result from each of the four possible combinations of perception and judgment.
以下各段簡要介紹了理論上所期望並在實踐中發現的兩種截然不同的個性，這些個性是由感知和判斷的四種可能組合中的每一種產生的。(Google 翻)

### Sensing Plus Thinking    

The ST (sensing plus thinking) people rely primarily on sensing for purposes of perception and on thinking for purposes of judgment. Thus, their main interest focuses upon facts, because facts can be collected and verified directly by the senses -- by seeing, hearing touching, counting, weighing, measuring. ST people approach their decisions regarding these facts by impersonal analysis, because of their trust in thinking, with its step-by-step logical process of reasoning from cause to effect, from premise to conclusion.  
ST（感知加思考）人員主要依靠感知來實現感知，並依靠思維來進行判斷。 因此，他們的主要興趣集中在事實上，因為可以通過感官直接收集和驗證事實-通過查看，聆聽觸摸，計數，稱重，測量來驗證事實。 ST人員基於對思維的信任，並通過逐個邏輯推理過程，從因果關係到從前提到結論，通過非個人化分析來對這些事實做出決策。(Google 翻)  

In consequence, their personalities tend to be practical and matter-of-fact, and their best chances of success and satisfaction lie in fields that demand impersonal analysis of concrete facts, such as economics, law, surgery, business, accounting, production,  and the handling of machines and materials.  
結果，他們的性格趨向於務實，事半功倍，他們成功和滿意的最佳機會就在於那些需要對具體事實進行非人為分析的領域，例如經濟學，法律，外科，商業，會計，生產和 機器和材料的處理。(Google 翻)  

### Sensing Plus Feeling  

The SF (sensing plus feeling) people, too, rely primarily on sensing for purposes of perception, but they prefer feeling for purposes of judgment. They approach their decisions with personal warmth because their feeling weighs how much things matter to themselves and others.  
SF（感覺加感覺）人也主要依靠感覺來達到感知的目的，但是他們更喜歡感覺來進行判斷。 他們以自己的熱情來決定自己的決定，因為他們的感覺決定著事情對自己和他人的重要性。(Google 翻)  

They are more interested in facts about people than in facts about things and, therefore, they tend to be sociable and friendly. They are more likely to succeed and be satisfied in work where their personal warmth can be applied effectively to the immediate situation, as in pediatrics, nursing, teaching (especially elementary), social work, selling of tangibles, and service-with-a-smile jobs.  
他們對人的事實比對事物的事實更感興趣，因此，他們傾向於社交和友好。 他們更有可能在工作中取得成功並感到滿意，在這種情況下，他們的個人溫暖可以有效地應用於當前情況，例如兒科，護理，教學（尤其是基礎教育），社會工作，有形物品銷售以及“提供服務” 微笑的工作。(Google 翻)  

### Intuition Plus Feeling  

The NF (intuition plus feeling) people possess the same personal warmth as SF people because of their shared use of feeling for purposes of judgment, but because the NFs prefer intuition to sensing, they do not center their attention upon the concrete situation. Instead they focus on possibilities, such as new projects (things that haven’t ever happened but might be made to happen) or new truths (things that are not yet known but might be found out). The new project or the new truth is imagined by the unconscious processes and then intuitively perceived as an idea that feels like an inspiration.  
NF（直覺加情感）人與SF人具有相同的個人溫暖，因為他們出於判斷目的共同使用感覺，但是由於NF寧願直覺而不是感覺，因此他們不會將注意力集中在具體情況上。相反，他們專注於可能性，例如新項目（從未發生過但可能會發生的事情）或新的真理（尚不知道但可能會發現的事情）。新項目或新真理是由潛意識的過程想像出來的，然後在直覺上被看作是一種靈感的想法。(Google 翻)   

The personal warmth and commitment with which the NF people seek and follow up a possibility are impressive. They are both enthusiastic and insightful. Often they have a marked gift of language and can communicate both the possibility they see and the value they attach to it. They are more likely to find success and satisfaction in work that calls for creativity to meet a human need. They may excel in teaching (particularly college and high school), preaching, advertising, selling of intangibles, counseling, clinical psychology, psychiatry, writing,  and most fields of research.   
NF員工尋求並追隨可能性的個人熱情和承諾令人印象深刻。他們既熱情又有見識。通常，他們擁有明顯的語言天賦，並且可以傳達他們看到的可能性和對其賦予的價值。他們更有可能在需要創造力來滿足人類需求的工作中獲得成功和滿足感。他們可能在教學（尤其是大學和高中），講道，廣告，無形資產銷售，諮詢，臨床心理學，精神病學，寫作和大多數研究領域中表現出色。(Google 翻)  


### Intuition Plus Thinking  

The NT (intuition plus thinking) people also use intuition but team it with thinking.  Although they focus on a possibility, they approach it with impersonal analysis. Often they choose a theoretical or executive possibility and subordinate the human element.   
NT（直覺加思考）也使用直覺，但將其與思考結合在一起。儘管他們專注於可能性，但是他們通過非個人分析來解決它。他們常常選擇理論或執行上的可能性並從屬於人為因素。(Google 翻)  

NTs tend to be logical and ingenious and are most successful in solving problems in a field of special interest, whether scientific research, electronic computing mathematics, the more complex aspects of finance, or any sort of development or pioneering in technical areas.  
NT往往具有邏輯性和獨創性，在解決特別感興趣的領域中的問題方面最成功，無論是科學研究，電子計算數學，金融的更複雜方面還是技術領域的任何形式的發展或開拓。(Google 翻)  

Everyone has probably met all four kinds of people: ST people, who are practical and matter-of-fact; the sympathetic and friendly SF people. NF people, who are characterized by their enthusiasm and insight; and NT people, who are logical and ingenious.  
每個人都可能會遇到所有四種人：ST人，他們務實而務實；富有同情心和友好的SF人。具有熱情和洞察力的NF人；和NT人士，他們富有邏輯性和獨創性。(Google 翻)  

The skeptic may ask how four apparently basic categories of people could have gone unnoticed in the past. The answer is that the categories  have been noted repeatedly and by different investigators or theorists.   
持懷疑態度的人可能會問，過去似乎沒有註意到四類基本的人。答案是類別已經被不同的研究者或理論家反复提及。(Google 翻)  

Vernon (1938) cited three systems of classification derived by different methods but which are strikingly parallel. Each reflects the combinations of perception and judgment: Thurstone (1931), by factor analysis of vocational interest scores, found four main factors corresponding to interest in business,  in people, in language, and in science; Gundlach and Gerum (1931), from inspection of interest intercorrelations,  deduced five main “type of ability,” namely, technical, social, creative, and intellectual, plus physical skill; Spranger (1928), from logical and intuitive considerations, derived six “types of men,” namely, economic, social religious, and theoretical, plus aesthetic and political.  
Vernon（1938）引用了三種分類方法，它們是通過不同的方法得出的，但它們卻是平行的。每個都反映了感知和判斷的結合：Thurstone（1931）通過對職業興趣分數的因素分析，發現了四個主要因素，它們對應於對商業，對人，對語言和對科學的興趣；貢德拉克和傑魯姆（Gundlach and Gerum，1931）從利益相關性的考察中得出了五種主要的“能力類型”，即技術，社會，創造力和智力以及身體技能。 Spranger（1928）從邏輯和直觀的角度出發，得出了六種“人的類型”，即經濟，社會宗教和理論，再加上美學和政治。(Google 翻)  

## The Extraversion-Introversion Preference  

Another basic difference in people’s use of perception and judgment arises from their relative interest in their outer and inner worlds. Introversion, in the sense given to it by Jung in formulating the term and the idea, is one of two complementary orientations to life; its complement is extraversion. The introvert’s main interests are in the inner world of concepts and ideas, while the extravert is more involved with the outer world of people and things. Therefore, when circumstances permit, the introvert concentrates perception and judgment upon ideas, while the extravert likes to focus them on the outside environment.   
人們使用感知和判斷力的另一個基本差異是由於他們對外部世界和內部世界的相對興趣。從榮格在表達術語和觀念時所給予的意義上講，內向是生活的兩個互補方向之一。它的補充是外向性。內向型人的主要興趣在於概念和思想的內在世界，而外向型人則更多地涉及人與物的外在世界。因此，在環境允許的情況下，性格內向的人將思想和判斷集中在思想上，而性格外向的人則喜歡將其集中在外部環境上。(Google 翻)  

This is not to say that anyone is limited either to the inner world or to the outer. Well-developed introverts can deal ably with the world or to the outer. Well-developed introverts can deal ably with the world around them when necessary, but they do their best work inside their heads, in reflection. Similarly well-developed extraverts can deal effectively with ideas, but they do their best work externally, in action. For both kinds, the natural preference remains,  like right of left-handedness.  
這並不是說任何人都局限於內部世界或外部世界。發達的性格內向的人可以與世界或外界相處融洽。發達的性格內向的人在必要時可以與周圍的世界相處融洽，但作為反思，它們會盡其所能。同樣，發達的外向型人也可以有效地處理想法，但在外部，他們會盡力而為。對於這兩種類型，自然偏好仍然存在，就像左撇子右手一樣。(Google 翻)  

For example, some readers, who would like to get to the practical applications of this theory, are looking at it from the extravert standpoint. Other readers, who feel more interest in the insight that the theory may provide for understanding themselves and human nature in general, are seeing it from the introvert point of view.   
例如，有些讀者想從理論的角度來研究該理論的實際應用。其他讀者對這種理論可能提供的洞察力感興趣，這些理論可以用來理解自己和一般人性，他們從內向的角度看待它。(Google 翻)  

Sing the EI preference (extraversion or introversion) is completely independent of the SN and TF preferences, extraverts and introverts may have any of the four combinations of perception and judgment. For example, among the STs, the introverts (IST) organize the facts and principles related to a situation; this approach is useful in economics or law. The extraverts (EST) organize the situation itself, including any idle by standers, and get things rolling, which is useful in business and industry. Things usually move faster for the extraverts; things move in a more considered direction for the introverts.    
唱EI偏好（外向或內向）完全獨立於SN和TF偏好，外向和內向可能具有感知和判斷的四種組合。例如，在ST中，性格內向的人（IST）組織與情況相關的事實和原則；這種方法在經濟學或法律上很有用。外向性組織（EST）自行組織情況，包括任何旁觀者閒置的情況，並使情況滾動，這在工商業中非常有用。外向型人的事情通常走得更快。對於內向的人，事情朝著更深思熟慮的方向發展。(Google 翻)  

Among the NF people, the introverts (INF) work out their insights slowly and carefully, searching for eternal verities. The extraverts (ENF) have an urge to communicate and put their inspirations into practice. If the extraverts’ results are more extensive, the introverts’ maybe more profound.  
在NF族中，性格內向的人（INF）緩慢而認真地表達自己的見解，以尋找永恆的真理。外向型人士（ENF）有溝通的衝動，並將他們的靈感付諸實踐。如果外向型的結果更廣泛，內向型可能會更深刻。(Google 翻)  

## The Judgment-Perception Preference  

One more preference enters into the identification of type -- the choice between the perceptive attitude and the judging attitude as a way of life, a method of dealing with the world around us. Although people must of course use both perception and judgment, both cannot be used at the same moment. So people shift back and forth between the perceptive and judging attitudes, sometimes quite abruptly, as when a parent with a high tolerance for children’s noise suddenly decides that enough is enough.   
類型的識別又是一種偏好-在感知態度和判斷態度之間進行選擇，作為一種生活方式，一種與周圍世界打交道的方法。儘管人們當然必須同時使用感知和判斷力，但不能同時使用兩者。因此，人們有時會突然在感知和判斷態度之間來回切換，就像父母對孩子的噪音容忍度很高時突然決定足夠就足夠了。(Google 翻)  

There is a time to perceive and a time to judge, and many times when either attitude might be appropriate. Most people find one attitude more comfortable than the other, feel more at home in it, and use it as often as possible in dealing with the outer world. For example, some readers are still following this explanation with an open mind; they are, at least for the moment, using perception. Other readers have decided by now that they agree or disagree; they are using judgment.   
有時間去感知和去判斷，而且很多時候哪種態度都合適。大多數人會發現一種態度比另一種更為舒適，在其中感覺更自在，並在與外界打交道時盡可能多地使用它。例如，一些讀者仍然以開放的心態來遵循這個解釋。至少目前，他們在使用感知。到目前為止，其他讀者已經決定同意還是不同意。他們正在運用判斷力。(Google 翻)  

There is a fundamental opposition between the two attitudes. In order to come to a conclusion, people use the judging attitude and have to shut off perception for the time being. All the evidence is in, and anything more is irrelevant and immaterial. The time has come to arrive at a verdict. Conversely, in the perceptive attitude people shut off judgment. Not all the evidence is in; new developments will occur. It is much too soon to do anything irrevocable.   
兩種態度之間存在根本的對立。為了得出結論，人們使用判斷態度，必須暫時關閉感知。所有的證據都在裡面，還有其他無關緊要的東西。作出判決的時候到了。相反，人們以敏銳的態度切斷判斷力。並不是所有的證據都在裡面。新的發展將會發生。做任何不可撤銷的事情為時過早。(Google 翻)  

This preference makes the difference between the judging people, who order their lives, and the perceptive people, who just live them. Both attitudes have merit. Either can make a satisfying way of life, if a person can switch temporarily to the opposite attitude when it is really needed.  
這種偏愛使判斷自己的人（生活秩序的人）與富有洞察力的人（生活的人）有所不同。兩種態度都有優點。如果一個人在真正需要時可以暫時轉向相反的態度，那麼任何一種都可以使人滿意。(Google 翻)  


## Summary of the Four Preferences  

Under the theory presented here, personality is structured by four preferences concerning the use of perception and judgment. Each of these preferences is a fork in the road of human development and determines which of two contrasting forms of excellence a person will pursue. How much excellence people actually achieve depends in part on their energy and their aspirations, but according to type theory, the kind of excellence toward which they are headed is determined by the inborn preferences that direct them at each fork in the road.  
根據這裡介紹的理論，人格由關於感知和判斷使用的四個偏好構成。 這些偏好中的每一個都是人類發展道路上的一個分支，並決定一個人追求兩種不同的卓越形式。 人們實際上能取得多少成就，部分取決於他們的精力和志向，但是根據類型理論，他們所追求的卓越程度取決於先天的偏好，這些偏好將他們引導到道路上的每個分支。(Google 翻)

------  

|  | Preference for | Affects a person's choice | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| EI | Extraversion or Introversion | To focus the dominant (favorite) process on the outer world or on the world of ideas |
| SN | Sensing or Intuition | To use one kind of perception instead of the other when either could be used |
| TF | Thinking or Feeling | To use one kind of judgment instead of the other when either could be used |
| JP | Judgment or Perception | To use the judging or the perceptive attitude for dealing with the outer world |

## Creation of "Type" by Exercise of the Preferences  

Under this theory, people create their “type” through exercise of their individual preferences regarding perception and judgment. The interests, values, needs, and habits of mind that naturally result from any set of preferences tend to produce a recognizable set of traits and potentialities.  
在這種理論下，人們通過行使個人對感知和判斷的偏好來創造自己的“類型”。 任何一組偏好自然產生的興趣，價值，需求和思維習慣往往會產生一組可識別的特徵和潛力。(Google 翻)  

Individuals can, therefore, be described in part by stating their four preferences, such as ENTP. Such a person can be expected to be different from others in ways characteristic of his or her type. To describe people as ENTPs does not infringe on their right to self-determination: They have already exercised this right by preferring E and N and T and P. Identifying and remembering people’s types shows respect not ojnly for their abstract right to develop along lines of their own choosing, but also for the concrete ways in which they are and prefer to be different from others.   
因此，可以通過陳述個人的四個偏好來部分描述個人，例如ENTP。 可以期望這樣的人在其類型特徵上與他人不同。 將人們描述為ENTP並不侵犯他們的自決權：他們已經通過偏愛E，N，T和P行使了這項權利。識別並記住人們的類型表明，他們不偏重於他們沿著路線發展的抽象權利。 他們自己的選擇，也取決於他們所處的具體方式，並且希望與他人有所不同。(Google 翻)  

## The Role of the Dominat Process  

It is easier to recognize a person’s preferred way of perception and way of judging than it is to tell which of the two is the dominant process. There is no doubt that a ship needs a captain with undisputed authority to set its course and bring it safely to the desired port. It would never make harbor if each person at the helm in turn aimed at a different destination and altered course accordingly.  
識別一個人偏愛的感知方式和判斷方式要比分辨兩者中的哪一個是主導過程要容易得多。毫無疑問，船舶需要擁有無可爭議的權威的船長來設定航向並將其安全地帶到所需的港口。如果掌舵的每個人依次瞄準不同的目的地並相應地改變航向，那將永遠不會成為港口。  

In the same way, people need some governing force in their makeup. They need to develop their best process to the point where it dominates and unifies their lives. In the natural course of events, each person does just that.  
同樣，人們在妝容中需要一些統治力。他們需要發展自己的最佳流程，使其支配和統一他們的生活。在自然事件中，每個人都這樣做。  

For example, those ENTs who find intuition more interesting than thinking will naturally give intuition the right of way and subordinate thinking to it. Their intuition acquires an unquestioned personal validity that no other process can approach. They will enjoy, use, and trust it most. Their lives will be so shaped as to give maximum freedom for the pursuit of intuitive goals. BEcause intuition is a perceptive process. These ENTs will deal with the world in the perceptive attitude, which makes them ENTPs.   
例如，那些覺得直覺比思考有趣的耳鼻喉科醫師自然會賦予直覺以通行權和從屬思維的權利。他們的直覺獲得了毫無疑問的個人有效性，這是其他任何過程都無法接近的。他們將最喜歡，使用和信任它。他們的生活將被塑造，以便為追求直觀目標提供最大的自由。因為直覺是一個感知過程。這些ENT將以感知的態度與世界打交道，這使其成為ENTP。  

They will consult their judgment, their thinking, only when it does not conflict with their intuition. Even then, they will use it only to a degree, depending on how well developed it is. They may make fine use of thinking in pursuit of something they want because of their intuition, but ENTPs will not permit thinking to reject what they are pursuing.   
只有在與自己的直覺不衝突時，他們才會徵求自己的判斷和思想。即使這樣，他們也只會在一定程度上使用它，這取決於它的開發程度。他們可能會因為直覺而善於利用思維去追求自己想要的東西，但是ENTP不允許思考拒絕他們追求的東西。  

On the other hand, those ENTs who find thinking more attractive than intuition will tend to let their thinking take charge of their lives, with intuition in second place. Thinking will dictate the goals, and intuition will only be allowed to suggest suitable means of reaching them. Since the process they prefer is a judging one, these ENTs will deal with the world in the judging attitude; therefore they are ENTJs.   
另一方面，那些覺得思維比直覺更具吸引力的耳鼻喉科將傾向於讓自己的思維掌控自己的生活，而直覺排在第二位。思維將決定目標，直覺將僅被允許提出實現目標的合適方法。由於他們喜歡的過程是一個判斷過程，因此這些ENT將以判斷態度與整個世界打交道。因此它們是ENTJ。  

Similarly, some ESFs find more satisfaction in feeling than in sensing; they let their feeling take charge of their lives, with sensing in second place. Feeling is then supreme and unquestioned. In any conflict with the other processes, feeling dominates. The lives of these ESFs will be shaped to serve their feeling values. Because of the preference for feeling, a judging process, they will deal with the world in the judging attitude. They are ESFJ.  
同樣，一些ESF在感覺上比在感覺上更滿意。他們讓自己的感覺掌控自己的生活，而感知則排在第二位。感覺是至高無上的。在與其他過程的任何衝突中，感覺占主導地位。這些ESF的生活將被塑造以服務於他們的情感價值。由於對感覺的偏好和判斷過程，他們將以判斷態度與世界打交道。他們是ESFJ。  

ESFJs will pay real attention to their perception, their sensing, only when it is in accord with their feeling. Even then, they will respect it only to a degree, depending on how well they have developed it. They will not acknowledge doubts raised by the senses concerning something valued by their feeling.  
ESFJ只會在符合他們的感覺時才真正關注他們的感知和感知。即使這樣，他們也只會在一定程度上尊重它，具體取決於他們的開發程度。他們不會承認感官對他們的感覺所重視的事物提出的疑問。  

However, other ESFs find sensing more rewarding than feeling and will tend to put sensing first and feeling in second place. Their lives will be shaped to serve their sensing -- to provide a stream of experiences that provide something interesting to see, hear, taste, or handle. Feeling will be allowed to contribute but not to interfere. Because sensing, a perceptive process, is preferred, these ESFs will deal with the world in the perceptive attitude, and therefore they are ESFPs.  
但是，其他ESF則發現感覺比感覺更有意義，並且傾向於將感覺放在第一位，將感覺放在第二位。他們的生活將被塑造以服務於他們的感知-提供一系列的體驗，這些體驗提供一些有趣的事物，以供觀看，聆聽，品嚐或操作。感覺會有所貢獻，但不能干預。由於感知是一個感知過程，因此這些ESF將以感知態度與世界打交道，因此它們是ESFP。  

This phenomenon, of the dominant process overshadowing the other processes and shaping the personality accordingly, was empirically noted by Jung in the course of his work and became, along with the extraversion-introversion preference, the basis of his Psychological Types.  
榮格在工作過程中憑經驗指出了這一現象，即占主導地位的過程蓋過了其他過程並相應地塑造了人格，並與外向內向型偏好一起成為他的心理類型的基礎。  

Some people dislike the idea of a dominant process and prefer to think of themselves as using all four processes equally. However, Jung holds that such impartiality, where it actually exists, keeps all of the processes relatively undeveloped and produces a “primitive mentality,” because opposite ways of doing the same thing interfere with each other if neither has priority. If one perceptive process is to reach a high degree of development, it needs undivided attention much of the time, which means that the other must be shut off frequently and will be less developed. If one judging process is to become highly developed, it must similarly have the right of way. One perceptive process and one judging process can develop side by side, provided one is used in the service of the other. But one process -- sensing, intuition, thinking, or feeling -- must have clear sovereignty, with opportunity to reach its full development, if a person is to be really effective.  
有些人不喜歡主導性過程的想法，而寧願認為自己平等地使用了所有四個過程。但是，榮格認為，這種公正性（實際上存在）使所有過程相對不發達，並產生了一種“原始心態”，因為如果沒有一個人優先考慮，做相同事情的相反方法會互相干擾。如果一個感知過程要達到較高的發展水平，那麼它在很多時候都需要全神貫注，這意味著必須經常關閉另一個感知過程，否則它就不會發展。如果一個審判程序要高度發展，它同樣必須具有通行權。一個感知過程和一個判斷過程可以並排發展，只要其中一個用於另一個。但是，如果一個人要真正變得有效，一個過程-感知，直覺，思考或感覺-必須擁有明確的主權，並有機會實現其全面發展。  


## The Role of the Auxiliary Process  

One process alone, however, is not enough. For people to be balanced, they need adequate (but by no means equal) development of a second process, not as a rival to the dominant process but as a welcome auxiliary. If the dominant process is a judging one, the auxiliary process will be perceptive: Either sensing or intuition can supply sound material for judgments. If the dominant process is perceptive, the auxiliary process will be a judging one: Either thinking or feeling can give continuity of aim.

If a person has no useful development of an auxiliary process, the absence is likely to be obvious. An extreme perceptive with no judgment is all sail and no rudder. An extreme judging type with no perception is all form and no content. 

In addition to supplementing the dominant process in its main field of activity, the auxiliary has another responsibility. It carries the main burden of supplying adequate balance (but not equality) between extraversion and introversion, between the outer and inner worlds. For all types, the dominant process becomes deeply absorbed in the world that interests them most, and such absorption is fitting and proper. The world of their choice is not only more interesting, it is more important to them. It is where they can do their best work and function at their best level, and it lays claim to the almost undivided attention of their best process. If the dominant process becomes deeply involved in less important matters are left to the auxiliary process. 

For extraverts, the dominant process is concerned with the outer world of people and things, and the auxiliary process has to look after their inner lives, without which the extraverts would be extreme in the extraversion and, in the opinions of their better-balanced associates, superficial. 

Introverts have less choice about participating in both worlds. The outer life is  thrust upon them whether they want one or not. Their dominant process is engrossed with the inner world of ideas, and the auxiliary process does what it can about their outer lives. In effect, the dominant process says to the auxiliary, “Go out there and tend to the things that can’t be avoided, and don’t ask me to work on them except when it’s absolutely necessary.”

Introverts are reluctant to use the dominant process on the outer world any more than necessary because of the predictable results. If the dominant process, which is the most adult and conscientious process, is used on outer things, it will involve the introverts in more extraversion than they can handle, and such involvement will cost them privacy and peace.

The success of introverts’ contacts with the outer world depends on the effectiveness of their auxiliary. If their auxiliary process is not adequately developed, their outer lives will be very awkward, accidental, and uncomfortable. Thus there is a more obvious penalty upon introverts who fail to develop useful auxiliary than upon the extraverts with a like deficiency.
