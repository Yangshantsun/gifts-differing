# An Orderly Reason for Personality Differences

It is fashionable to say that the individual is unique. Each is the product of his or her own heredity and environment and, therefore, is different from everyone else. From a practical standpoint, however, the doctrine of uniqueness is not useful without an exhaustive case study of every person to be educated or counseled or understood. Yet we cannot safely assume that other people’s minds work on the same principles as our own. All too often, others with whom we come in contact do not reason as we reason, or do not value the thins we value, or are not interested in what interests us.    
現在很流行地說每個人都是獨一無二的。每個都是他或她自己的遺傳和環境的產物，因此，這世界上絕不存在兩個完全相同的人。但是，從實踐的角度來看，如果沒有對每個人進行詳盡的案例研究，就不能對唯一性原則有用。但是，我們不能安全地假設別人的思想與我們自己的思想相同。通常，與我們接觸的其他人不會像我們那樣推理，或者不珍惜我們珍視的東西，或者對我們感興趣的東西不感興趣。(Google翻)  
  
The merit of the theory presented here is that it enables us to expect specific personality differences in particular people and to cope with the people and the differences in a constructive way. Briefly, the theory is that much seemingly chance variation in human behavior is not due to chance; it is in fact the logical result of a few basic, observable differences in mental functioning.  
這裡介紹的理論的優點在於，它使我們能夠期待特定人的特定人格差異，並以建設性的方式應對人與人之間的差異。簡而言之，該理論認為，人類行為中看似偶然的變化並不是偶然的。實際上，這是心理功能上一些基本的，可觀察到的差異的邏輯結果。(Google翻)  
  
These basic differences concern the way people prefer to use their minds, specifically, the way they perceive and the way they make judgments. Perceiving is here understood to include the processes of becoming aware of things, people, occurrences, and ideas. Judging includes the processes of coming to conclusions about what has been perceived. Together, perception and judgment, which make up a large portion of people’s total mental activity,  govern much of their outer behavior, because perception -- by definition -- determines what people see in a situation, and their judgment determines what they decide to do about it. Thus, it is reasonable that basic differences in perception or judgment should result in corresponding differences in behavior.  
這些基本差異關係到人們喜歡使用思想的方式，特別是他們的感知方式和做出判斷的方式。在這裡，感知被理解為包括對事物，人，事件和思想的認識的過程。評判包括就所感知的事物得出結論的過程。感知和判斷共同構成了人們總體心理活動的很大一部分，支配著他們的許多外在行為，因為感知（根據定義）決定了人們在某種情況下所看到的東西，而判斷則決定了他們決定要做的事情關於它。因此，合理的認識或判斷上的差異應導致相應的行為差異。(Google 翻)  

## Two Ways of Perceiving

As Jung points out in Psychological Types, humankind is equipped with two distinct and sharply contrasting ways of perceiving. One means of perception is the familiar process of sensing, by which we become aware of things directly through our five senses. The other is the process of intuition, which is indirect perception by way of the unconscious, incorporating ideas or associations that the unconscious tacks on to perceptions coming from outside. These unconscious contributions range from the merest masculine “hunch” or “woman’s intuition” to the crowning examples of creative art or scientific discovery.
正如榮格在《心理類型》中指出的那樣，人類擁有兩種截然不同且截然相反的感知方式。感知的一種方法是熟悉的感知過程，通過它我們可以通過五種感覺直接感知事物。另一個是直覺的過程，它是通過無意識的方式進行的間接感知，並結合了無意識對來自外部的感知的想法或聯想。這些無意識的貢獻從最男性化的“預感”或“女性的直覺”到創造性藝術或科學發現的最高典範。(Google翻)

The existence of distinct ways of perceiving would seem self-evident.  People perceive through their senses, and they also perceive things that are not and never have been present to their senses. The theory adds the suggestion that the two kinds of perception compete for a person’s attention and that most people, from infancy up, enjoy one more than the other. When people prefer sensing, they are so interested in the actuality around them that they have little attention to spare for ideas coming faintly out of nowhere. Those people who prefer intuition are so engrossed in pursuing the possibilities it presents that they seldom look very intently at the actualities. For instance, readers who prefer sensing will tend to confine their attention to what is said here on the page. Readers who prefer intuition are likely to read between and beyond the lines to the possibilities that come to mind.
存在不同的感知方式似乎是不言而喻的。人們通過自己的感官來感知，他們也可以感知那些從來沒有出現過的東西。該理論增加了一種建議，即兩種感知力爭奪一個人的注意力，並且大多數人從嬰儿期開始就比另一種享有更多的享受。當人們更喜歡感知時，他們對周圍的現實非常感興趣，以至於他們幾乎沒有註意力去避開那些虛幻的想法。那些喜歡直覺的人全神貫注於追求它所帶來的可能性，因此他們很少非常專心地看待現實。例如，喜歡感應的讀者會傾向於將注意力集中在頁面上的講話中。那些喜歡直覺的讀者可能會在可能出現的界限之間或之外閱讀。(Google翻)


As soon as children exercise a preference between the two ways of perceiving, a basic difference in development begins. The children have enough command of their mental processes to be able to use the favorite processes more often and to neglect the processes they enjoy less. Whichever process they prefer, whether sensing or intuition, they will use more, paying closer attention to its stream of impressions and fashioning their idea of the world from what the process reveals. The other kind of perception  will be background, a little out of focus.
一旦孩子在兩種感知方式之間選擇了偏愛，發育方面的基本差異就會開始。孩子們對自己的心理過程有足夠的控制能力，可以更多地使用自己喜歡的過程，而忽略了自己所享受的過程。無論他們喜歡哪個過程，無論是感知還是直覺，他們都將更多地使用它，密切關注它的印象流，並根據過程所揭示的內容塑造他們對世界的看法。另一種看法將是背景，有點模糊。(Google翻)

With the advantage of constant practice, the preferred process grows more controlled and more trustworthy. The children become more adult in their use of the preferred process than in their less frequent use of the neglected one. Their enjoyment extends from the process itself to activities requiring the process, and they tend to develop the surface traits that result from looking at life in a particular way. 
憑藉不斷實踐的優勢，首選過程變得更加可控且更可信賴。與不經常使用被忽視的孩子相比，兒童在使用首選方法時變得更加成人。他們的樂趣從過程本身擴展到需要過程的活動，並且他們傾向於發展以特定方式看待生活所產生的表面特徵。(Google翻)

Thus, by a natural sequence of events, the child who prefers sensing and the child who prefers intuition develop along divergent lines. Each becomes relatively adult in an area where the other remains relatively childlike. Both channel their interests and energy into activities that give them a chance to use their mind the way they prefer. Both acquire a set of surface traits that grows out of the basic preferences beneath. This is the SN preference: S for sensing and N for intuition.
因此，通過自然的事件序列，喜歡感知的孩子和喜歡直覺的孩子會沿著分歧的方向發展。在彼此保持相對童年的地區，每個人都相對成年。雙方都將自己的興趣和精力投入到活動中，使他們有機會以自己喜歡的方式使用自己的思想。兩者都獲得了一系列表面特徵，這些特徵是從下面的基本偏好中衍生出來的。這是SN偏好：S代表感應，N代表直覺。(Google翻)

## Two Ways of Judging

A  basic difference in judgment arises from the existence of two distinct and sharply contrasting ways of coming to conclusions. One way is by the use of thinking, that is, by a logical process, aimed at an impersonal finding. The other is by feeling, that is, by appreciation -- equally reasonable in its fashion -- bestowing on things a personal, subjective value.  
  
These two ways of judging would also seem self-evident. Most people would agree that they make some decisions with thinking and some with feeling, and that the two methods do not always reach the same result from a given set of facts. The theory suggest that a person is almost certain to enjoy and trust one way of judging more than the other. In judging the ideas presented here, a reader who considers first whether they are consistent and logical is using thinking judgment.  A reader who is conscious first that the ideas are pleasing or displeasing, supporting or threatening ideas already prized, is using feeling judgment.  
  
Whichever judging process a child prefers he or she will use more often, trust more implicitly, and be much more ready to obey. The other kind of judgment will be a sort of minority opinion, half-heard and often wholly disregarded.  
  
Thus, the child who prefers thinking develops along divergent lines from the child who prefers feeling, even when both like the same perceptive process and start with the same perceptions. Both are happier and more effective in activities that call for the sort of judgments that they are better equipped to make. The child who prefers feeling becomes more adult in the handling of human relationships. The child who prefers thinking grows more adept in the organization of facts and ideas. Their basic preference for the personal or the impersonal approach to life results in distinguishing surface traits. This is the TF preference: T for thinking and F for feeling.
